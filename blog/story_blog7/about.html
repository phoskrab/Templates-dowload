      <h3>From a migrant worker to a Python programmer</h3>
      <p>
        Kimsal was born close to Thailand in Banteay Meanchey province. 80 to 90% of the people who live in that area have, at one point or another, been migrant workers in Thailand. Kimsal was one of them. He needed money to survive and Cambodia didn’t have many jobs, so Kimsal left his village to work in his neighboring country, even though he was still in school. Kimsal was born in a big family with 9 other siblings. Many of his siblings went to work in Thailand, a tradition that started during his father’s generation. His father once told him that he needed to work in Thailand to feed all his children. Kimsal would spent 3 weeks out of 4 to work in Thailand, spending only 1 week in school. Each day, 300 to 400 people from his area would go to work in Thailand leaving from the port of PoiPet, on the Thai border.
