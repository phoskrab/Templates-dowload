                A bitcoin exchange was dismantled on July 2nd and 3rd in southern France and its three co-founders arrested. 388 bitcoins were seized, which roughly represents 180 000 euros at press time.

                The authorities’ official communiqué states that this operation was carried out because of the ‘illicit’ nature of this exchange. According to this communiqué, the organization was conducting ‘illegal banking, gambling, betting activities’.

                The exchange manager, his wife and another partner were arrested – two of them were put under legal supervision, the third person was released.
